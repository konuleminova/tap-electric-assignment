# simple weather app - flutter

Display weather details on your current or any specific location.

## Assignment parameters

Perform two tasks on the repo:

1. Create or extend a feature. For example: add a weather forecast, let the user switch between Fahrenheit, Kelvin and Celsius, etc.
2. Refactor existing code (feature or architectural)

During the interview we will go over your tasks. You will be asked to explain your code and reasoning and to give us a little (tech) roadmap of what else you would like to see done in the code.
We expect you to spend no more than 3 hours on the assignment. 

Please send the resulting code via Git or zip to q@tapelectric.app and nico@tapelectric.app 3 hours in advance of our interview.
